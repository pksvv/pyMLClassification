Nimmi - avid book reader - library 

Created a list of books which she has read in the past along with liked or not - Dataset - 1000 books

Questions - Arranged q in such a way that the objective type are first and detailed q are further down
who is author
when was book published
what is the genre of book

Splitting attributes - features - guide us where to split

Vishal - Algorithm - Decision Tree - Classifier

Problem Statement : Can you please help me find whether I will like the books on not?

Type of Problem : Classification

Pattern / Question - Answer Model

new books in library - nimmi can use that model to predict whether he will like the book or not

1. Historical Labelled Dataset

2. Questions - Attribute Selection Measures

3. Algorithm - DTC

4. Model

Problem - Overfit

Nimmi & Vishal called 9 more friends, so 10 friends in total

Tore list into slips of 100 books each and then put those 10 lists into bag

Pick a slip ask Questions and put it back into bag

Iteration # 1
V - slip # 1
F1 - slip # 2

Iteration # 2
V - slip # 1
F1 - slip # 2

Iteration # 3
V - slip # 2
F1 - slip # 1

Sampling with Replacement - Bootstrap Sampling - Bootstrapping

10 friends - 10 models - 10 iterations - All were working parallel

Aggregation of results of all those models - averaging - voting

Bootstrapping + Aggregation = Bagging Algorithms
